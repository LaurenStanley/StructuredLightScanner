# StructuredLightScanner
Structured Light Scanner OpenCV Project

This structured light scanner code is used to interpret a series of images with structured light projected onto them to recreate a 3D point cloud of a desired object.
This project began as the final project for a computer vision course, with simulated images from Blender used for the input, but has been expanded for real camera and projector setup.
